# detection-reconstruction
Object Recognition and Reconstruction was explored in floor plan SFPI Dataset. First the dataset must be downloaded and save it to a directory to run the .ipynb file. Here is the link of our floor plan dataset https://cloud.dfki.de/owncloud/index.php/s/mkg5HBBntRbNo8X. If there is any problem to open the notebook file please go to the link https://nbviewer.org/ and paste https://github.com/akhi527/detection-reconstruction. The Floor plan recogniiton part was done by using the MMDetection toolbox and reconstruction is followed by the methodology of this paper: Zeng, Z., Li, X., Yu, Y. K., & Fu, C. W. (2019). Deep floor plan recognition using a multi-task network with room-boundary-guided attention. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 9096-9104).
